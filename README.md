# Web Dev Practice

Welcome to my Web Development Practice repository! This project serves as a portfolio of my learning journey and personal experiments in web development.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### 1. [Course Tutorials](./Course_Tutorials)
This folder contains exercises and code snippets from various web development tutorials I have followed. It tracks my progress in learning concepts like:
- HTML5 Structure
- CSS Styling (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design)
- JavaScript Basics

### 2. [My Projects](./My_Projects)
This folder houses my personal projects, experiments, and playground code where I apply what I've learned. It includes:
- Interactive web pages
- JavaScript logic exercises (Calculators, Factorials, etc.)
- Styling experiments

### Highlights

## Further Learning

Since starting with these basics, I have advanced to building applications using modern frameworks and tools. You can check out my other repositories for projects built with:

- **Angular**: For robust single-page applications.
- **Streamlit**: For data-driven web apps and rapid prototyping.
